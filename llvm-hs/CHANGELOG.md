## 4.2.0 (2017-06-20)

* Revamp OrcJIT API
  * The user facing API is now exposed using `LLVM.OrcJIT`.
  * All user facing functions have been documented.
  * In addition the bracket-style API, there are now `new*` and
    `dispose*` functions making it easier to ingegrate OrcJIT in
    custom monad transformer stacks.
  * There is a new `CompileLayer` typeclass which abstracts over the
    various compile layers in `OrcJIT`.
* Support QuickCheck 2.10

## 4.1.0 (2017-05-17)
